# PR Shepherd

Push a draft PR and iterate until CI passes and review comments are resolved, then mark ready for review.

## Default Commenting Mode

Use **inline-first** commenting by default.

- For code-specific feedback, always post/reply on the exact line thread.
- Use top-level PR comments only for cross-cutting concerns that do not map to one line, or outage/fallback summaries.
- When both are possible, choose inline.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Push & Create Draft PR
1. Commit staged changes (use git-commit-assistant conventions).
2. Push the branch to origin.
3. Create a **draft** PR via `gh pr create --draft`.

### Step 2: Wait for CI
1. Run `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>` to get an early read.
2. If any checks are still pending, sleep ~180 seconds.
3. Run `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>` again to observe final CI status.

### Step 3: Evaluate CI Results
- **All checks pass** → proceed to Step 4.
- **Failures** → read the failing job logs (`gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed`), diagnose the root cause, fix it, commit, push, and loop back to Step 2.

### Step 4: Check PR Comments
1. Fetch **inline** review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments`
2. Fetch **general** PR comments: `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --comments`
3. For each comment, respond **on the comment itself** (threaded reply), never move an inline discussion to the general PR thread:
   - **Inline review comments** → reply via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{comment_id}/replies -f body="..."`
   - **General discussion comments** → reply via `gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "..."`
4. Decision per comment:
   - **Agree?** → Fix the code, commit, push. Reply on the comment acknowledging the fix.
   - **Disagree?** → Reply on the comment with clear reasoning explaining why.
   - **Question/clarification?** → Reply on the comment with the answer.

### Step 4.4: Canonical Intake → Decisions → Batches → Validation → Push
Run the review loop through the canonical review-intelligence pipeline:

1. Collect one intake payload per cycle:
   - `ci_checks`
   - `inline_comments`
   - `general_comments`
   - `existing_findings`
2. Normalize intake to canonical findings:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py normalize-pr-intake --input <intake.json> --output <review_findings.json>`
3. Build decision backlog with shared policy:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py build-backlog --findings <review_findings.json> --output <review_backlog.json>`
4. Build actionable non-overlapping batches:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py build-fix-batches --backlog <review_backlog.json> --output <fix_batches.json>`
5. Select concrete validation per actionable finding:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_select_tests.py --finding <finding.json> [--repo-inventory <repo_inventory.json>]`
   - Persist returned `validation_steps` on backlog items so validation scope is stable for execution.
6. Execute one batch at a time:
   - Apply only that batch’s `fix_now` / `verify_first` items.
   - Run validation steps in order (Level 0 → Level 1 → Level 2 when present).
   - Push once after that batch validates.
7. Classify loop stop after each cycle:
   - `python3 scripts/quest_review_intelligence.py classify-pr-stop --ci-state <green|failing|pending|unknown> --actionable <count> --iteration <n> --backlog <review_backlog.json>`
   - If cap is enforced, classification handles in-place retagging and deferred backlog append for newly deferred findings.
   - Continue only when classification outcome is `continue`.

### Step 4.5: Inline Commenting Playbook
Use this for every inline review reply so comments feel coaching-oriented and actionable.

Inline posting defaults:
- New review findings should be posted as inline PR comments (`pulls/{pr}/comments`) whenever a valid `path` + `line` exists.
- If line mapping fails for one finding, continue posting other valid inline findings.
- If all inline postings fail, post a single PR-visible fallback summary comment.

Comment formula:
1. Start with a small positive anchor.
2. Name the issue precisely (what and why).
3. Suggest a concrete fix (or two).
4. Keep tone warm; humor is optional and brief.

Example shape:
`Nice cleanup here. One tiny gremlin: <specific issue>. Could we <specific fix>?`

Tone rules:
- Be kind, not vague.
- Be direct, not sharp.
- Prefer "could we" / "suggest" over commands.
- Avoid sarcasm.
- Avoid bundling unrelated nits into one comment.

Inline scope rules:
- One comment = one issue.
- Place the comment exactly on the relevant line.
- Use top-level PR comments for larger cross-cutting concerns.
- If blocking, state why it is blocking in one sentence.

Severity labels (optional but recommended):
- `blocker`: correctness, security, broken behavior
- `important`: maintainability/readability risk
- `nit`: style or polish

Signature requirement for every posted review comment:
`- Reviewed by <model>, in collaboration with <github username>`

Ready-to-use template:
`Nice improvement here. One small gremlin: <issue>. This can cause <impact>. Suggestion: <specific change>.`
`- Reviewed by <model>, in collaboration with <github username>`

### Step 4.6: Decision Policy Alignment
When reducing findings to actionable buckets, align with `.skills/review-decisions/SKILL.md`:
- Use only `fix_now`, `verify_first`, `defer`, `drop`, `needs_human_decision`
- Keep reasoning explicit for deferred and dropped findings
- At loop cap, convert unresolved items to `defer` (accepted debt) or `needs_human_decision`

### Step 5: Re-check CI (if changes were made)
If any fixes were pushed in Step 4, loop back to Step 2.

### Step 6: Mark Ready for Review
Once CI is green AND all comments are addressed:
```
gh pr ready <PR_NUMBER>
```
Inform the user the PR is ready for their review.

## Key Principles
- Never mark ready-for-review while CI is failing.
- Never ignore review comments — always respond.
- Keep fix commits small and focused; don't bundle unrelated changes.
- Use `classify-pr-stop` for loop-cap enforcement; do not prompt the user before cap retagging is applied. Prompt only if post-retag items still require `needs_human_decision`.

## Command Invocation

Run `gh` commands directly — not through `bash -lc`, `sh -c`, or other shell wrappers.
Permission prefixes (e.g. `["gh","pr"]`) only match when `gh` is the top-level command.
Wrapping in a shell defeats prefix matching and triggers repeated permission prompts.
Use shell wrappers only when you need pipes, redirects, or multi-command composition.
